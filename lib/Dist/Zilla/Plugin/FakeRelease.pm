=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::FakeRelease - fake plugin to test release

=head1 VERSION

version 1.100160

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin is a C<Releaser> that does nothing. It is directed to plugin
authors, who may need a dumb release plugin to test their shiny plugin
implementing C<BeforeRelease> and C<AfterRelease>.

When this plugin does the release, it will just log a message and finish.

If you happen to have a C<DIST_ZILLA_FAKERELEASE_FAIL> environment var
set, the plugin will die instead of logging and exiting nicely. This can
be interesting for authors wanting to test reliably that release failed.
