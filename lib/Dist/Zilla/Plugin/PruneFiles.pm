=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PruneFiles - prune arbirary files from the dist

=head1 VERSION

version 1.002

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This plugin allows you to specify filenames to explicitly prune from your
distribution.  This is useful if another plugin (maybe a FileGatherer) adds a
bunch of files, and you only want a subset of them.

In your F<dist.ini>:

    [PruneFiles]
    file = xt/release/pod-coverage.t ; pod coverage tests are for jerks

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 filenames

This is an arrayref of filenames to be pruned from the distribution.  It's
initialized by the C<file> argument to the plugin constructor (and, therefore,
in the config).
