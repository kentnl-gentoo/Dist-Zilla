=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::UploadToCPAN - upload the dist to CPAN

=head1 VERSION

version 1.093371

=head1 SYNOPSIS

If loaded, this plugin will allow the F<release> command to upload to the CPAN.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin looks for configuration in your C<dist.ini> or
C<~/.dzil/config.ini>:

  [=Dist::Zilla::App::Command::release]
  user     = YOUR-PAUSE-ID
  password = YOUR-PAUSE-PASSWORD

If this configuration does not exist, it can read the configuration from
C<~/.pause>, in the same format that L<cpan-upload> requires:

  user YOUR-PAUSE-ID
  password YOUR-PAUSE-PASSWORD
