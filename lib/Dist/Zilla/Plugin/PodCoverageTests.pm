#
# This test uses L<Pod::Coverage::TrustPod> to check your Pod coverage.  This
# means that to indicate that some subs should be treated as covered, even if no
# documentation can be found, you can add:
#
#   =for Pod::Coverage sub_name other_sub this_one_too
#
# L<Test::Pod::Coverage> C<1.08> and L<Pod::Coverage::TrustPod> will be added as
# C<develop requires> dependencies.

# Register the release test prereq as a "develop requires"
# so it will be listed in "dzil listdeps --author"
