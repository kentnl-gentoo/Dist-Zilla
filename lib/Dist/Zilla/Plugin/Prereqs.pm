=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs - list simple prerequisites

=head1 VERSION

version 4.200006

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

  [Prereqs]
  Foo::Bar = 1.002
  MRO::Compat = 10
  Sub::Exporter = 0

Which is equivalent to specifying prerequisites for the C<Runtime>
phase:

  [Prereqs / RuntimeRequires]
  Foo::Bar = 1.002
  MRO::Compat = 10
  Sub::Exporter = 0

See L</Phases> for the full list of supported phases.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds "fixed" prerequisites to your distribution.  These are prereqs
with a known, fixed minimum version that doens't change based on platform or
other conditions.

You can specify prerequisites for different phases and kinds of relationships.
In C<RuntimeRequires>, the phase is Runtime and the relationship is Requires.
These are described in more detail in the L<CPAN::Meta
specification|CPAN::Meta::Spec/PREREQUISITES>.

The phases are:

=over 4

=item *

configure

=item *

build

=item *

test

=item *

runtime

=item *

develop

=back

The relationship types are:

=over 4

=item *

requires

=item *

recommends

=item *

suggests

=item *

conflicts

=back

If the phase is omitted, it will default to I<runtime>; thus, specifying
"Prereqs / Recommends" in your dist.ini is equivalent to I<RuntimeRecommends>.

Not all of these phases are useful for all tools, especially tools that only
understand version 1.x CPAN::Meta files.
