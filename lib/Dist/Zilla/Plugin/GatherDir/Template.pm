=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GatherDir::Template - gather all the files in a directory and use them as templates

=head1 VERSION

version 4.300008

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a very, very simple L<FileGatherer|Dist::Zilla::FileGatherer> plugin.
It looks in the directory named in the L</root> attribute and adds all the
files it finds there.  If the root begins with a tilde, the tilde is replaced
with the current user's home directory according to L<File::HomeDir>.

It is meant to be used when minting dists with C<dzil new>, but could be used
in building existing dists, too.
