=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Types - dzil-specific type library

=head1 VERSION

version 4.101611

=head1 OVERVIEW

This library provides L<MooseX::Types> types for use by Dist::Zilla.  These
types are not (yet?) for public consumption, and you should not rely on them.

Dist::Zilla uses a number of types found in L<MooseX::Types::Perl>.  Maybe
that's what you want.
