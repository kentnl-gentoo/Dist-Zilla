=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::App::Command::run - run stuff in a dir where your dist is built

=head1 VERSION

version 1.100660

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ dzil run ./bin/myscript
    $ dzil run prove -bv t/mytest.t
    $ dzil run bash

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command will dzil-build your dist, then build the distribution
and finally run a command in this directory. It's ultimately like
doing this:

    dzil build
    rsync -avp My-Project-version/ .build/
    cd .build
    perl Makefile.PL            # or perl Build.PL
    make                        # or ./Build        
    export PERL5LIB=$PWD/blib/lib:$PWD/blib/arch
    <your command as defined by rest of params>

Except for the fact it's built directly in a subdir of .build (like
F<.build/asdf123>).

A command returning with an non-zero error code will left the build
directory behind for analysis, and dzil will exit with status 1.
Otherwise, the build directory will be removed and dzil will exit
with status 0.
