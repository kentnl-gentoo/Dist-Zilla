=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::App::Command::clean - clean up after build, test, or install

=head1 VERSION

version 4.300033

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  dzil clean [ --dry-run|-n ]

This command removes some files that are created during build, test, and
install.  It's a very thin layer over the C<L<clean|Dist::Zilla/clean>> method
on the Dist::Zilla object.  The documentation for that method gives more
information about the files that will be removed.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 -n, --dry-run

Nothing is removed; instead, everything that would be removed will be listed.
