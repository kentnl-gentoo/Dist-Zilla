=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::App::Command::nop - initialize dzil, then exit

=head1 VERSION

version 4.200007

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This command does nothing.  It initializes Dist::Zill, then exits.  This is
useful to see the logging output of plugin initialization.

  dzil nop -v

Seriously, this command is almost entirely for diagnostic purposes.  Don't
overthink it, okay?
