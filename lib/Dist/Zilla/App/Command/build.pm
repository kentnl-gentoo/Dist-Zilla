=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::App::Command::build - build your dist

=head1 VERSION

version 4.300012

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  dzil build [ --trial ] [ --tgz | --no-tgz ] [ --in /path/to/build/dir ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is a very thin layer over the Dist::Zilla C<build> method, which
does all the things required to build your distribution.  By default, it will
also archive your distribution and leave you with a complete, ready-to-release
distribution tarball.

=head1 EXAMPLE

  $ dzil build
  $ dzil build --no-tgz
  $ dzil build --in /path/to/build/dir

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 --trial

This will build a trial distribution.  Among other things, it will generally
mean that the built tarball's basename ends in F<-TRIAL>.

=head2 --tgz | --no-tgz

Builds a .tar.gz in your project directory after building the distribution.

--tgz behaviour is by default, use --no-tgz to disable building an archive.

=head2 --in

Specifies the directory into which the distribution should be built.  If
necessary, the directory will be created.  An archive will not be created.
