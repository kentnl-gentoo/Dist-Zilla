=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::MVP::Assembler::GlobalConfig - Dist::Zilla::MVP::Assembler for global configuration

=head1 VERSION

version 4.102220

=head1 OVERVIEW

This is a subclass of L<Dist::Zilla::MVP::Assembler> used when assembling the
global configuration.  It has a C<stash_registry> attribute, a hashref, into
which stashes will be registered.

They get registered via the C<register_stash> method, below, generally called
by the C<register_component> method on L<Dist::Zilla::Role::Stash>-performing
class.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 register_stash

  $assembler->register_stash($name => $stash_object);

This adds a stash to the assembler's stash registry -- unless the name is
already taken, in which case an exception is raised.
