=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Role::FileMunger - something that alters a file's destination or content

=head1 VERSION

version 4.101812

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A FileMunger has an opportunity to mess around with each file that will be
included in the distribution.  Each FileMunger's C<munge_files> method is
called once.  By default, this method will just call the C<munge_file> (note
the missing terminal 's') once for each file.

This method is expected to change attributes about the file before it is
written out to the built distribution.
