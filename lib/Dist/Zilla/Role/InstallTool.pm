Dist::Zilla::Role::InstallTool - something that creates an install program for a dist

=head1 VERSION

version 1.091440

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Plugins implementing InstallTool have their C<setup_installer> method called to
inject files after all other file injection and munging has taken place.
They're expected to write out files needed to make the distribution
installable, like F<Makefile.PL> or F<Build.PL>.
