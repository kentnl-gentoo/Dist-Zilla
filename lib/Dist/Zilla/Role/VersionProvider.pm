=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Role::VersionProvider - something that provides a version number for the dist

=head1 VERSION

version 4.300003

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Plugins implementing this role must provide a C<provide_version> method that
will be called when setting the dist's version.

If a VersionProvider offers a version but one has already been set, an
exception will be raised.  If C<provides_version> returns undef, it will be
ignored.
