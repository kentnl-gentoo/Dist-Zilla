=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Role::MVPReader - stored configuration loader role

=head1 VERSION

version 4.101582

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The config role provides some helpers for writing a configuration loader using
the L<Config::MVP|Config::MVP> system to load and validate its configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 assembler

The L<assembler> attribute must be a Config::MVP::Assembler, has a sensible
default that will handle the standard needs of a config loader.  Namely, it
will be pre-loaded with a starting section for root configuration.  That
starting section will alias C<author> to C<authors> and will set that up as a
multivalue argument.
