=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Role::Plugin - something that gets plugged in to Dist::Zilla

=head1 VERSION

version 4.101580

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Plugin role should be applied to all plugin classes.  It provides a few key
methods and attributes that all plugins will need.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 plugin_name

The plugin name is generally determined when configuration is read.

=head2 zilla

This attribute contains the Dist::Zilla object into which the plugin was
plugged.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 log

The plugin's C<log> method delegates to the Dist::Zilla object's
L<Dist::Zilla/log> method after including a bit of argument-munging.
