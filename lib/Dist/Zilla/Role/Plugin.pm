=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Role::Plugin - something that gets plugged in to Dist::Zilla

=head1 VERSION

version 1.091370

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Plugin role should be applied to all plugin classes.  It provides a few key
methods and attributes that all plugins will need.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 plugin_name

The plugin name is generally determined when configuration is read.  It is
initialized by the C<=name> argument to the plugin's constructor.

=head2 zilla

This attribute contains the Dist::Zilla object into which the plugin was
plugged.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 log

The plugin's C<log> method delegates to the Dist::Zilla object's
L<Dist::Zilla/log> method.
