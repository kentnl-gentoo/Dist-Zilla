=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Role::TestRunner - something used as a delegating agent to 'dzil test'

=head1 VERSION

version 1.093400

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Plugins implementing this role have their C<test> method called when
testing.  It's passed the root directory of the build test dir.

=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

=head2 test

  ->test( $build_dir )

This method should return C<undef> on success.

Any other value is interpreted as an error message, and no more tests are run.

Calling "die" inside test also will be caught.

The following 2 subs should behave(mostly) the same:

    sub test {
        die "Failed";
    }

    sub test {
        return "Failed";
    }
