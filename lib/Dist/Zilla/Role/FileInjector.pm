=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Role::FileInjector - something that can add files to the distribution

=head1 VERSION

version 5.009

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role should be implemented by any plugin that plans to add files into the
distribution.  It provides one method (C<L</add_file>>, documented below),
which adds a file to the distribution, noting the place of addition.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 add_file

  $plugin->add_file($dzil_file);

This adds a file to the distribution, setting the file's C<added_by> attribute
as it does so.
