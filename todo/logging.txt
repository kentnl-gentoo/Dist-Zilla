# LOG PROPERLY

Log::Dispatchouli should be good enough.  It gets us log, log_fatal, and
log_debug.  Needing more seems crazy.

We can try to override logging on a single dzil object, but we log things
before the object is instantiated, so that might be hard.  We can try to
instantiate earlier, but that will depend on ditching most of the core required
attributes -- which is good for other reasons.

We want to log like:

  [Dist::Zilla] this is being logged by the core
  [Dist::Zilla] [Plugin] some plugin is logging this entry
  [Dist::Zilla] [Plugin] [Subplug] and this plugin has its own plugins

Log::Dispatchouli has already been updated to make this easier by joining
multiple join hunks.

## TO DO

* add a mechanism for all plugins to say $self->log($message)
* add a mechanism for plugins to provide logging to sub-plugins
* make sure the log-to-self feature of Log::Dispatchouli can be enabled for
  testing
