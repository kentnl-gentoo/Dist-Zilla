# VIRTUAL FILESYSTEM TO REPLACE "FILES" ARRAY

Right now, files are simple objects stored in an array.  This is nice and
simple, but also a bit of a mess.  It allows duplicate filenames forces us to
use regex to find files in a given directory, and so on.  Instead, we should
use Path::Resolver (or something) to build a simple virtual filesystem.

Then we could have filename changes detect conflicts immediately, we could have
$file->replace_with( $other_file ), and other nice improvements.
