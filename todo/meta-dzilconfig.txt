# REPORT DZIL CONFIG IN DISTMETA

I'd like to be able to look at META.json and determine (more or less) the
configuration of the Dist::Zilla setup that built the dist.  This can be
optional with a MetaProvider.  The means for a plugin to provide a subset of
its configuration for this kind of thing should be generic, though.

Maybe Plugin should provide:

  sub _build_config_summary {
    my ($self) = @_;
    my %config = inner();
    return \%config;
  }

...or something like that.
