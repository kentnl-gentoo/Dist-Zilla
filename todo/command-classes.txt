# SIMPLIFY COMMAND CLASSES

Most of the command plugins for `dzil` should be very, very small:

  package Dist::Zilla::App::Command::foo;
  sub execute {
    $self->zilla->foo;
  }

This means moving a bunch of logic into Zilla.pm, which should be easy.

More important will be moving around configuration.

I really don't like putting CPAN/PAUSE credentials in the global !release
config.  It doesn't exactly make sense.  It should be more related to
UploadToCPAN.

I don't have a plan yet.
